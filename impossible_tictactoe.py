worst case scenario (MAX LOSS), and is formulated for player ZRO-SUM games...

MINIMAX VALUE - Of a player is the smallest value that the other players can force the player to receive, without knowing the player's actions; equivalently, it is the largest value the player can be sure to get when they know the actions of the other players.
